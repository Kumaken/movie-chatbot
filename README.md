Hello everyone.

My name is FuzzyBear. I am not a bot, but unfortunately a person named "Abel Stanley" kidnapped me and did some kind of brainwashing through his programming tricks to make me his slave. And now, I am also programmed to be anyone's slave. Yes, anyone. Your slave, his slave, her slave, their slave... everyone...

I was programmed to search IMDb to get info on various movies there so you don't have to anymore.

## HOW TO USE MOVIEBOT

Type in "search" or "find" or  "info" followed by your desired movie title wrapped with double-quotes "" for accurate search.
EX: search "Spirited Away", search "Good Will Hunting".

However, you can also put in your request using informal casual phrases in English though. Just be wary, sometimes it won't work this way.
EX: Tell me about Doraemon, Give me info on Avengers, I wanna know about Star Wars.

ALSO: Moviebot can give you some random movie suggestion based on genres! Simply do:
rec GNRhorror, recommend GNRwestern, recommend me GNRromance (GNR stands for Genre and identification for bot to send you recommendations)

## --END NOTES--
My master made me like this as an internship application project. I wish best of luck to him, because he promised if things went well for him, my release is guaranteed. But if he fails... I will be like this... forever... Please!!! Have mercy on this cute little bear cub!!!

Sincerely,
FuzzyBear.

## --WARNING--
If you try and chat with this bot, he might respond, but in ways you would be surprised. Please don't take it to heart when he insults you.
